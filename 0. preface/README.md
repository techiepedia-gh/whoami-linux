# Preface: You're Probably Doing Linux Wrong

Let’s be honest.

Most people using Linux barely understand what they're doing.
- They memorize commands without knowing why they work.
- They install packages like magic spells.
- They panic when the terminal shows an error.

**If that's you — it's fine. You're here to change that.**

This `repository` is not just about giving you commands to copy-paste. It’s about:
- Understanding how Linux works under the hood
- Building habits that make you confident in a real environment
- Teaching you how to *think* in Linux, not just use it

You won’t be treated like a child here. But you also won’t be expected to know everything.

This is structured to take you from zero to functional — in the right order — without the fluff.

Each topic is followed by a **Checklist**. If you can tick everything in the list without guessing, you’re ready to move on.

## Checklist Format (Follow this for every topic)

After completing, ask yourself:

- [ ] Can I explain what a Linux distribution is?
- [ ] Do I know the difference between Linux and GNU/Linux?
- [ ] Do I understand what a shell is and why we use it?
- [ ] Can I navigate directories using basic terminal commands?
- [ ] Am I Linux God? (no, you are not!)

If you can’t confidently check them off — go back. Re-read. Practice.

No shortcuts.  
No sugarcoating.  
Just proper Linux skills.

Let’s begin.
