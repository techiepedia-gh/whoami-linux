# You Guys Are Dumb (But It’s Not Your Fault)

Hey there,  
Yeah… you.


Scrolling through GitHub thinking you know Linux because you typed `ls` once.  
Or worse — still copy-pasting `sudo apt install` without the faintest clue what it *actually* does.

**Deffo dumb!**

But hey — we all started that way.  
No one’s born knowing what the hell a kernel is or why `chmod 755` sounds like some secret alien code.

You’ve been betrayed by:
- Windows, OS that hides the truth
- And 97 “Linux for Beginners” tutorials that assume you’re already a sysadmin

So this repo?  
*It’s here to fix that!*

It won’t hold your hand, but it’ll slap some sense into you — lovingly.

We’re starting from **GROUND ZERO**.  
(No assumptions. No BS.)  
Just straight-up Linux knowledge, the way it was meant to be learned:  
⚔️ painfully, ✨ but with memes.

By the end of this journey:
- You’ll speak CLI fluently.
- Laugh at people who fear the CLI & Linux (okay, not really… but maybe a little)

So buckle up & Stop being **DUMB**.  
And let’s learn this thing properly — one shell command at a time.
Let the madness begin!
